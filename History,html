<h3> The History of Ice Cream....probably....</h3>
<p>There was once a man named Cream. He had bright orange hair that glowed in the dark. He lived in a town where ice was a delicacy, which the king supplies.</p>
<o>One day, he made the king very unhappy, so he lost his access to ice.</o>
<p>No one knows why, but Cream decided to go and confront the king</p>
<p>He reached the palace, and he barged in.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the king was very caln. He invited him to eat with him</p>
<p>Cream was confused but he complied. He finished his dinner and was presented with ice.</p>
<p>But there was one odd thing, the king graciously gave his piece of ice to Cream.</p>
<p>He ate the ice. But then everything went dark </p>

<h3>Across the kingdom, 5 months later.</h3>
<p>Cream's cousin managed to bring some ice home.
    As he bit the ice, everything was going well. However, the torches in his room blew out. But there was one orange light. In the ice he was eating, there was a piece of orange hair stuck inside the ice.
